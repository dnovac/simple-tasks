This project was made with the purpose of learning ReactJS.

The boilerplate was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## App description
The app `simple-tasks` that can be used to track routine/daily tasks, that does not require much than a couple minutes to complete. The user can add new tasks in order to track, or remove the ones from the loaded sample. When the task is completed, the user is notified.

## Data Storage
The data is stored on browser's localStorage.


## Deploy the app
In order to run the app on your local machine, clone the app and run:
`npm install`
`npm start`
The app wil run on port 3000.

## Disclaimer 
The code is open source, so suggestions of what I could've done better are welcomed.
